Mostly using this to clean up files full of Tweets so I can train a neural net to tweet like Trump. 

# Instructions

1. Run "npm install" (or "yarn install") to install all node dependencies.
2. Put all your Tweet files in the "data" folder, then run "npm start".
3. Output will be dumped to the console, but you can redirect it to a file. i.e. "npm start > output.txt".
